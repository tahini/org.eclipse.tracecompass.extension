/**
 * This interface represents a host system, for example a machine running Linux,
 * and allows to access information on the state of the machine at some
 * time[range]. Typically, there would be one model instance per host and all
 * traces taken on the same host (machine) will share the same model.
 *
 * Users of the model do not need to know where the information comes from. For
 * each method providing information, a default value will be provided in case
 * the information is not available. See the method's javadoc for that value.
 *
 * How the host information is accessed is up to each implementations. It can
 * make use of the various analyses of the traces that compose this model.
