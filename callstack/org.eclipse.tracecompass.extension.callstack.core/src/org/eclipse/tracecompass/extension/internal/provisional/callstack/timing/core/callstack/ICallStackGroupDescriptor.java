/**
 * This interface describes a group in the callstack. A group can either be a
 * source group under which other groups are, or a leaf group, under which is
 * the actual stack.
 *
 * Example: Let's take a trace that registers function entry and exit for
 * threads and where events also provide information on some other stackable
 * application component:
 *
 * The structure of this callstack in the state system could be as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  Per PID
 *    [pid]
 *        [tid]
 *            callstack
 *               1  -> function name
 *               2  -> function name
 *               3  -> function name
 *  Per component
 *    [application component]
 *       [tid]
 *           callstack
 *               1 -> some string
 *               2 -> some string
 * </pre>
 *
 * There are 2 {@link CallStackSeries} in this example, one starting by "Per
 * PID" and another "Per component". For the first series, there could be 3
 * {@link ICallStackGroupDescriptor}: "Per PID/*", "*", "callstack".
 *
 * If the function names happen to be addresses in an executable and the PID is
 * the key to map those symbols to actual function names, then the first group
 * "Per PID/*" would be the symbol key group.
 *
 * Each group descriptor can get the corresponding {@link ICallStackElement}s,
 * ie, for the first group, it would be all the individual pids in the state
 * system, and for the second group, it would be the application components.
 * Each element that is not a {@link ICallStackLeafElement} will have a next
 * group descriptor that can fetch the elements under it. The last group will
 * resolve to leaf elements and each leaf elements has one {@link CallStack}
 * object.
